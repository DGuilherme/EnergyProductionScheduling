For the data explanation, we considered as example, from the small set SFJW, the first data instance SFJW 01 
which can be understood as follows. Firstly, the three values in the first row represent the number of jobs, 
machines and workers respectively. Secondly, the values in the other rows describe the processing time of all 
operations on each available machine assigned to each available worker, where the fist value denotes the number 
of operations in the corresponding job, and the second value means the number of available machines for the first 
operation followed by machine number. For each machine number, the next value is the number of available workers 
able to control it, and followed by a group of combinations (worker, processing time) that indicate the processing 
time for each selected worker: 

2 2 2
2 2 1 2 1 25 2 30 2 1 1 37 2 1 1 2 32 2 2 1 24 2 33
2 2 1 1 1 45 2 2 1 55 2 65 2 1 2 1 21 2 25 2 1 2 65

The values in the first row mean that there are 2 jobs, 2 machines and 2 workers in the instance. 
In the second row, the first value 2 denotes that there are 2 operations in job 1 and the second value 2 
means that 2 machines are available to process O11: where the first machine 1 can be controlled by 2 workers, 
the worker 1 with a processing time of 25 and the worker 2 with 30. The next machine 2, can be controlled by 
1 worker which is worker 1 with a processing time of 37. For the second operation O12, 2 machines are available: 
the machine 1 can be controlled by only 1 worker which is worker 2 with a processing time of 32, and the machine 2 
is composed by 2 workers, the worker 1 with a processing time of 24 and the worker 2 with a processing time of 33.
